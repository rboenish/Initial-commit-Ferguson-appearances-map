To reflect this broader vision, Anthropic renamed the Claude Code SDK to the Claude Agent SDK.\n\n### Personal Assistant Agent Capabilities\nPersonal assistant agents can help you book travel and manage your calendar, as well as schedule appointments, put together briefs, and more by connecting to your internal data sources and tracking context across applications.\n\n### New API Capabilities (October 2025)\nAnthropic announced four new capabilities on the API: the code execution tool, MCP connector, Files API, and the ability to cache prompts for up to one hour. Together with Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4, these features enable developers to build agents that execute code for advanced data analysis, connect to external systems through MCP servers, store and access files efficiently across sessions, and maintain context for up to 60 minutes with cost-effective caching.\n\n### Claude Cowork (January 2026)\nAnthropic released Cowork on January 12, 2026, a new feature embedded in the Claude Desktop macOS application.(no content)The tool grants users the ability to delegate file management, document generation, and data processing tasks to Claude within designated local folders.(no content)Available as a research preview for Claude Max subscribers ($100-200/month), Cowork represents Anthropic's strategic push beyond developer tools into the mainstream productivity market.\n\n### Pricing in 2026\nWith Anthropic's release of the Claude 4.5 series in late 2025, Claude Opus 4.5 delivers flagship performance at 67% lower cost than its predecessor, while new optimization features like prompt caching and batch processing can reduce costs by up to 90%.\n\n### Integration Options\n- Home Assistant has an integration that adds a conversation agent powered by Anthropic, such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Controlling Home Assistant is done by providing the AI access to the Assist API.\n- The growing ecosystem of remote MCP servers means you can easily add capabilities to your AI applications without building one-off integrations. You can integrate with any remote MCP server, including those from Zapier and Asana.\n\n### Official Resources\n- Anthropic offers a comprehensive video course that teaches developers how to integrate Claude AI into applications using the Anthropic API. The curriculum covers fundamental API operations, advanced prompting techniques, tool integration, and architectural patterns for building AI-powered systems.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"3d9cb0be-afe1-435a-a2e0-e4ad11cb4ca3","timestamp":"2026-01-28T20:02:34.658Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Anthropic Claude personal assistant agent API integration 2026","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01SqKG4ueh9Pa2xkXv5ebUX1","content":[{"title":"Anthropic Conversation - Home Assistant","url":"https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/anthropic/"},{"title":"Building agents with the Claude Agent SDK","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk"},{"title":"Anthropic Claude API Pricing 2026: Complete Cost Breakdown | MetaCTO","url":"https://www.metacto.com/blogs/anthropic-api-pricing-a-full-breakdown-of-costs-and-integration"},{"title":"Anthropic Claude Messages API - Amazon Bedrock","url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-anthropic-claude-messages.html"},{"title":"New capabilities for building agents on the Anthropic API | Claude","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/agent-capabilities-api"},{"title":"GitHub - anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python","url":"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python"},{"title":"Claude Cowork: Anthropic Brings AI Agent Capabilities to Non-Technical Users","url":"https://developer.tenten.co/claude-cowork-anthropic-brings-ai-agent-capabilities-to-non-technical-users"},{"title":"Moltbot: The Ultimate Personal AI Assistant Guide for 2026 - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/czmilo/moltbot-the-ultimate-personal-ai-assistant-guide-for-2026-d4e"},{"title":"Claude API Guide: Build AI Agents & Chatbots (2025)","url":"https://www.spurnow.com/en/blogs/claude-api-guide"},{"title":"Building with the Claude API - Anthropic Courses","url":"https://anthropic.skilljar.com/claude-with-the-anthropic-api"}]},"Here are the search results for Anthropic Claude personal assistant agent API integration in 2026:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Claude Agent SDK\nThe Claude Agent SDK is a collection of tools that helps developers build powerful agents on top of Claude Code.(no content)The agent harness that powers Claude Code (the Claude Code SDK) can power many other types of agents.
